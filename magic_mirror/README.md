1. Install the "MagicMirror²" add-on.
1. Start the "MagicMirror²" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "MagicMirror²" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the dashboard at this url `http://hassio.local:8181`

## Addon Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
    "gitupdate": true,
    "npmupdate": false,
    "npminstall": false,
    "modules": [
        { "name": "MMM-OnScreenMenu", "git": "https://github.com/shbatm/MMM-OnScreenMenu" },
        { "name": "DailyXKCD", "git": "https://github.com/Blastitt/DailyXKCD.git" }
    ]
}
```

### Option: `gitupdate`

The `gitupdate` option will run a git pull to get the latest version of MagicMirror²
from [https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
when the addon starts up.

### Option: `npmupdate`

This option will call a npm update to ensure it is latest, this may be needed
if you are using your own modules or have a security issue.

### Option: `npminstall`

If enabled npm install will be run after the git update. Off by default.

### Option: `modules`

This is a collections of modules you want to have installed for your system. It
will pull them down and run a `npm install` on them for you.

## Example

When installed it will place a pre-configured config file in place to get you started. Thie
can be edited. Please make sure you do not change the Home Assistant urls as they are for
the internal API Proxy used by HASS.

## MagicMirror² configuration and user manuals

The add-on does not configure MagicMirror² for you. When it starts it will create
a default configuration file in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

Under the root of the Home Assistant directoy a folder called `magicmirror` will
be created. Uner that there will be three more folders. These are

* config - Contains the config.js and example.
* css - Any custom css changes will be copied over.
* modules - Any custom modules will be copied over.

When the addon starts it will copy these settings into the container and start the
MagicMirror² process. If you edit or update these you will need to restart the
MagicMirror² addon in the HASS.IO interface.

If you use the modules folder in the Home Assistant configuration make sure you
have done a `npm install` as it is just copied across.

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed Magic Mirror directly into Home Assistant.
Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` component, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  MagicMirror:
    title: Magic Mirror
    icon: mdi:image-filter-frames
    url: http://addres.to.your.hass.io:8181
```
